This report is aiming to reflect the infection situation of covid 19 among countries, including Germany, China,
Japan, United Kingdom, US, Brazil, Mexico. 

The two main indicators are the change in the number of cases and the change in rate by country. 
Moreover, the coefficient day will also be discussed, which indicates the speed of increasing accumulated number of people infected. The coefficient of 'log(Pupolation)' illustrate the impact of one infection on whole population infection. For instance, the coefficient of `log(Population)` is 1.11, which means that for every 1% increase in the population of an area, its accumulative number of infections will increase by about 1.11%. 

In general, from the figure, it can be found that each country has a different growth trend of accumulated infections. The peak infection time period happened from January 2020 to January 2022. It can be seen that the country with the first cases is China, but the the overall cases in China began to grow slowly by the end of March 2020, and began to grow rapidly in March 2022. For the rest of the countries, it started to grow rapidly in April 2020, and the growth rate has been maintained at a high level since then. From January 2021, among these countries, the United States will have the most infections and China the least.

The highest cumulative number of infection appears in UK while other countries have less coefficient impact.
